## to run the app:
* open shell ( on windows cmd )
* git clone https://github.com/marcodemoja/gift_card.git
* go to the  project directory - "cd gift_card"
* execute "npm install && npm run start"


#### to see the development environment with webpack in watch mode please run npm run dev



## Things to improve:
* to work on a webpack configuration for production environment - js  minified/compressed/uglifyed
* a smarter filter system - I wanted to work better on this but at the same time I was taking too long
* to write some unit test
* to have a working version of the card animation for IE older versions - maybe using modernizr to make the check and jquery to create the animation
* make the CSS full responsive
